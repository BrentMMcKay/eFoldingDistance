# eFoldingDistance
This is a python module to compute eFolding distances of correlation of temperature measurements between sites.

Included are the module itself and jupyter notebooks with sample code to make calculations with various datasets: NOAA's Global Historical Climate Network Monthly temperature dataset (a fixed width file example) and ECMWF's ERA20C Monthly temperature dataset (a NETCDF example). URLs are included in the notebooks, and the downloaded datasets are included in this repo.

Sample output PNG files are included in the repository; these were produced by running the jupyter notebooks.
